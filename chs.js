    "You nod, and bid farewell to the apprentice.\n          \nYou are aware this is quite the old building, where wizards used to live and study several generations ago. You consider the basement may be full of things that could help expand your knowledge. However, you recall the apprentice's warning: it will probably be dangerous. You strongly consider arming yourself with a weapon and some protection before heading in, though you admit you may already be equipped for it.\n\nMaybe this is why the researcher was also excited about making weapons...?\n\n**You have unlocked the \"Exploration\" feature! You can access this feature from the left-side menu. Explore various locations to discover a wide array of new things; but beware, as powerful foes may be lurking behind every corner!**": "你点点头，与学徒告别。\n \n你知道这是一座相当古老的建筑，几代人以前，巫师们曾在这里生活和学习。 您认为地下室可能充满了可以帮助您扩展知识的东西。 但是，你记得学徒的警告：这可能会很危险。 你强烈考虑在进入之前用武器和一些保护措施武装自己，尽管你承认你可能已经为此做好了准备。\n\n也许这就是为什么研究人员也对制造武器感到兴奋......？\n\n* *您已解锁“探索”功能！ 您可以从左侧菜单访问此功能。 探索不同的地点，发现各种各样的新事物； 但要小心，强大的敌人可能潜伏在每个角落！**",
    "As you continue fighting the animals that infest the school basement, you get a sudden realization. What if you actually used magic to fight back? You give it a try, and are easily able to fell one of those mice that pester you as you look around the basement.\n    \nThat was definitely powerful! You can't wait to go back and ask your researcher to start studying this. This is an entirely new school of magic of its own.\n\n**You have completed the \"Evocation\" storyline and have permanently unlocked the Evocation school! You may now do research on Evocation, which will let you learn damaging combat spells. This will persist even after restarting the game!**": "当您继续与侵扰学校地下室的动物战斗时，您突然意识到。 如果你真的用魔法反击怎么办？ 你试一试，当你环顾地下室时，很容易就能抓住一只缠着你的老鼠。\n \n这绝对是强大的！ 你迫不及待地想回去让你的研究人员开始研究这个。 这是一个全新的魔法学校。\n\n**你已经完成了“召唤”故事情节并永久解锁了 召唤 学校！ 你现在可以研究召唤，这会让你学习破坏性的战斗法术。 这甚至在重新启动游戏后仍然存在！**",
    "Felling those enemies is interesting, as sometimes you can find useful items afterwards. You have noticed, however, that they also leave behind some material that you have been calling \"Monstium\". You are not sure what it does, but it feels somewhat hazardous.\n    \nThere might be a way to store more of this... You think for a bit, and devise a larger storage unit, with more capacity than warehouses, and with a special compartment dedicated to potentially dangerous materials. To make it truly work, you think of imbuing it with mana. You are eager to give it a try.\n\n**You can now build Monstruariums!**": "击败那些敌人很有趣，因为有时您可以在之后找到有用的物品。 然而，你已经注意到，他们也留下了一些你一直称之为“妖物”的材料。 你不确定它的作用，但感觉有点危险。\n \n可能有一种方法可以存储更多这些...你想了想，设计了一个更大的存储单元，容量比仓库大，并且 有一个专门用于存放潜在危险材料的特殊隔间。 为了让它真正发挥作用，你会考虑给它注入法力。 你迫不及待地想尝试一下。\n\n**你现在可以建造 妖物宝窟 了！**",
    "A young woman, dressed as a wizarding apprentice shows up on campus with a crystal ball.\n    \n\"Headmaster, your magical prowess is known far and wide\", she says. \"Crystal balls are important magical artifacts that can be used to know the future. I would like to know my own destiny, but my skill is not strong enough. Perhaps you can help me...?\" she asks, looking at you.": "一位年轻女子，打扮成巫师学徒，拿着水晶球出现在校园里。\她说：“校长，你的魔法能力广为人知。”\“水晶球是重要的魔法物品，可以用来预测未来。我想知道自己的命运，但我的技能不够强。也许你可以帮助我……”她看着你问道。",
    "You pool together even more mana. The staff begins to shine! You feel the magical energies starting to roar.

    "You utilize your Illusion prowess to create a fuzzy image inside the crystal ball. You pretend to be focused in divining the future as the apprentice watches in awe.\n          \nAs the illusion runs its course, you appear to exit your trance. You tell the woman that she is destined to learn magic and refine her powers at your institution. As much of a lie as it was, she falls for it.\n\n\"Wow... so that's really my destiny\", she says, while lost in thought. \"Then I should comply. ...I-I know that if you go against destiny, you will never be able to be successful... ...Can I stay here and study magic?\", she asks. You nod.\n\n**You have obtained an extra apprentice!**": "你利用你的幻觉能力在水晶球内创造一个模糊的图像。当学徒敬畏地看着你时，你假装专注于预测未来。\n \n当幻象运行时，你似乎退出了恍惚状态。你告诉这位女士，她注定要在你的机构学习魔法并提升自己的能力。尽管这是一个谎言，但她还是相信了。\n\n\“哇……这真的是我的命运”，她一边沉思一边说道\她问道：“那么我应该遵守……我知道，如果你违背命运，你将永远无法成功……我能留在这里学习魔法吗？”。你点头。\\n\n**您获得了一个额外的学徒**",
    "You use your Illusion knowledge to trick the merchant and give him 4330 fake stones. The merchant falls for it!\n          \n\"Here are your coins\", he says. \"Nice doing business with you!\". He walks away afterwards.\n\nHe will be in for a surprise later, but you are happy you got the coins!": "你用你的幻觉知识欺骗商人并给了他 4330 颗假石头。 商人上当了！\n \n\“这是你的硬币\”，他说。 \“和你合作很愉快！\”。 之后他就走开了。\n\n他稍后会给你一个惊喜，但你很高兴你得到了硬币！",
    "As you manage to defeat the powerful Skeleton, you notice what it was guarding all along: a staircase down to what seems to be... another floor? What could possibly be down here?\n  \nThe mysteries abound, and you recall what your researcher told you before. The event called Tournament of Magic. You still feel very far away from that, but through this adventure, you have already managed to discover an entire school of magic. You realize that this might just be the best way forward to actually be able to participate in the event. You arm yourself with more courage before moving on into the unknown...\n\n**You can now enter the School Basement B2! You can access this floor by pressing the \"Next Floor\" button in the Exploration screen.**": "当您设法打败强大的骷髅时，您会注意到它一直在守卫的东西：一条通往似乎是……另一层楼的楼梯？ 这里可能有什么？\n \n谜团比比皆是，你还记得你的研究人员之前告诉过你的话。 该活动称为魔术锦标赛。 你仍然觉得离那个很远，但通过这次冒险，你已经成功地发现了整个魔法学校。 您意识到这可能只是真正能够参与活动的最佳方式。 在进入未知世界之前，你要用更多的勇气武装自己……\n\n**你现在可以进入学校地下室 B2 了！ 您可以通过在探索屏幕中按“下一层”按钮来访问该楼层。**",

    "Gathering Mana is useful, but why would you do it if you had nothing to use it for?\n\nYou slowly recall how to cast spells and remember a basic Conjuration spell, *Create Pebble*.

You can cast spells by pressing the wand icon at the top right or bottom right corner of the screen.**": "收集法力很有用，但如果你没有什么用，你为什么要这样做呢？\n\n你慢慢回忆起如何施法并记住一个基本的召唤法术，*创造鹅卵石*。 你想尽快尝试一下！\n\n**你已经解锁了施法的能力！ 您可以通过按屏幕右上角或右下角的魔杖图标来施法。**",

    "It hasn't been very long since you completed your magical studies, but you still feel like you barely learned anything. But even among the little things you did learn, you remember: after gathering Mana, you are supposed to use it to channel it into elemental Essences...\n    \n  **You have gained the ability to Channel elemental Essences! You can do so from the Spell menu.**": "你完成魔法学习没多久，但你仍然觉得自己几乎什么都没学到。但即使是在你确实学过的小事情中，你也记得:在收集法力之后，你应该使用它来将其转化为元素精华……\n \n **你已经获得了传送元素精华的能力!可以在法术菜单中进行操作。**",

    "With more Mana reserves, you have managed to stockpile some elemental Essence. You think of saving some room in your home for magical storage furniture, so you can stockpile even more.\n\nYou briefly ask yourself: why would you even want more? But you rid yourself of that thought - with this much Essence, the magical power you have is still very limited... you will surely need to accumulate more.\n    \n**You can now build Essence Storages, which allow you to hold more elemental Essence at once!**": "有了更多的法力储备，你已经设法储存了一些元素精华。你想在家里留出一些空间来放置神奇的储物家具，这样你就可以储存更多的家具。你简单地问自己:为什么你想要更多?但是你摆脱了这种想法——有了这么多精华，你拥有的魔力仍然非常有限……你肯定需要积累更多。\n \n**你现在可以建立精华存储，它可以让你一次持有更多的元素精华!**。",

    "With a more stable Mana income, you feel a little relieved - it is one less problem off your hands. However, your reserves are still not very large. It would be great if you could cast more powerful spells, but that requires more Mana...\n\nYou remember your basic lessons, that spoke of earthern shards that could increase this capacity, which can also be easily built. You will need to try that...\n    \n**You can now build Mana Shards!**": "有了更稳定的法力值收入，你会感到些许宽慰——你又少了一个麻烦。然而，你们的储备仍然不是很大。如果你能施放更强大的咒语就好了，但这需要更多法力……你记得你的基本课程，说到地球碎片可以增加这种能力，它也可以很容易地建造。你需要尝试一下……\n \n**你现在可以建立魔法碎片!**。",
